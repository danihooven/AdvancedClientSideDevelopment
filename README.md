# AdvancedClientSideDevelopment
Franklin U Coursework

This course builds on the fundamental concepts of constructing web pages by expanding into robust, efficient, and highly responsive client side applications of current web technologies. Students will apply advanced techniques that employ scripting languages, libraries, and frameworks to build interactive front ends to server applications. These web pages will be single page applications that use asynchronous scripting language callbacks to provide user interactivity. These applications will consume RESTful services.
